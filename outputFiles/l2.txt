Trust me and take my hand
When the lights go out you will understand
Anger and agony
Are better than misery
Trust me I've got a plan
When the lights go off you will understand
I know (I know I know I know I know)
That you're wounded
You know (You know you know you know you know)
That I'm here to save you
